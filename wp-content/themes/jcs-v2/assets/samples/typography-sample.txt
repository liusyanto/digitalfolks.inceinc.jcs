<p>This is an example page. It's different from a blog post because it will stay in one place and will show up in your site navigation (in most themes). Most people start with an About page that introduces them to potential site visitors. It might say something like this:</p>
<blockquote>Hi there! I'm a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my website. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like piña coladas. (And gettin' caught in the rain.)</blockquote>
<p>...or something like this:</p>
<blockquote>The XYZ Doohickey Company was founded in 1971, and has been providing quality doohickeys to the public ever since. Located in Gotham City, XYZ employs over 2,000 people and does all kinds of awesome things for the Gotham community.</blockquote>

	<li><strong>Waves</strong> - Ben Thouard is a photographer from the South of France, specialized in surf photography. The attraction for me in this shot is the smoothness of the curves and the beautiful variations of blue.</li>
	<li><strong>Tropical</strong> - Clever usage of very minimal elements. Just a few lines and curves are enough to convince the thought of birds and waves. Even the curves of her backside are just right. By <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2537541-Tropical">MUTI</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Bright Classroom</strong> - Illustration depicting the future of the classroom. Her skirt has such inspiring pattern. Feet, hands and legs aren’t easy to draw and here the elegance is done with perfection. Designed by Sam Chivers.</li>

<p><a href="http://gruntjs.com/blog/2016-04-04-grunt-1.0.0-released">Grunt 1.0.0</a> has been released. Long time no hear, it’s still one of the most used task runners for front-end workflows. Now finally the stable release is out, and with it, many bugs and glitches have been fixed, making it now a robust solution for long-term projects. I’m excited to hear that the development roadmap has very nifty features for it to keep evolving in the future.</p>
<h3>Something else comes to mind perhaps?</h3>
<p>If you use GitLab, the self-hosted alternative to GitHub, you can now also create <a href="https://pages.gitlab.io/">GitLab Pages</a>, using a static site builder of your choice (like Jekyll, Hexo, Middleman, or others). You can also easily set up HTTPS for them, and — even better — there are <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/issues/1096">plans to integrate Let’s Encrypt in it</a>, so you get a “seamless” HTTPS experience along the way. This is quite amazing to see as it has strong potential now to replace many hosted services with just one self-hosted GitLab server for many people.</p>

	<li><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/04/web-development-reading-list-131/">Last week</a> I mentioned a social-engineering attack to repositories using Greenkeeper. The developers of the tool now reacted and offer users a method to <a href="https://greenkeeper.io/verify.html">verify the identity of the Greenkeeper bot</a>. As it turns out, the<a href="https://github.com/blog/2144-gpg-signature-verification">new GitHub feature that shows verified commits using PGP signatures</a>isn’t very helpful for that kind of attacks.</li>
	<li>A spectacular announcement regarding content security has been made this week by Whatsapp: <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/whatsapp-complete/">all (group) messages, calls are now End-To-End encrypted</a> with Open Whisper Systems’ protocol. While this is great to see as it enables encryption for over 1 billion users, you should be aware that your metadata attached to Whatsapp is still not encrypted and while your message content is encrypted for all in-between, Whatsapp is still closed source and they could theoretically build in a logger prior to when the content is encrypted without you noticing it.</li>
